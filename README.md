# Advent Of Code
This repo contains my AoC solutions, only in Python for now. For each year you'll find a directory containing:
*  one Python file per day (xx.py),
*  a data folder with the example and generated input files (.ex and .in),
*  a functions.py file with all the modules I used and a few boiler-plate functions.
